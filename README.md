# Data Collection
### 2018 FIFA World Cup Russiaâ„¢ Prediction Project

The goal of this notebook is to show how I collected data from the FIFA World Cup website. Data was collected using a web crawler, due to lack of API.

The content of this notebook is as follows:

1. Web crawler code in .py format - heavily commented version, used to teach others how to build a similar program
2. Web crawler code in Jupyter notebook format 
3. requirements.txt
